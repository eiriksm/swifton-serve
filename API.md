# Serve Swifton.me üç∏

The `Serve` API is used to create and query about Swift Apps running on this server.

# Preamble

This service and api is provided as-is, no one takes any responsibility for what you're using it for, also no guarantees are made about uptime etc.

**Currently no authentication is needed to deploy Apps, this will change in the future. Until then Apps will most likely be shut down at any time. (When it seems like they're exhausting the system.)**
